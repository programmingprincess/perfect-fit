## Notes 

`perfect-fit-storage@mozilla.org.json` needs to be placed in `~/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/ManagedStorage` in order to save user size information throughout multiple sessions. 

## TODO

- [ ] Allow users to select bust/waist preference for tops 
- [ ] Auto-calculate bust/waist/hip sizes based on numeric/letter size (i.e., given S, calculate Bust = 32 and Waist = 24...)
- [ ] Men's sizing 
- [ ] Integrate front-end and back-end 
- [ ] Figure out ambiguity between "tops" vs. "shirts" vs. "sweaters" (store naming conventions)
